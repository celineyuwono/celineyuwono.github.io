            I have a hard time finishing things. I often get bored along the way.
            Being able to speak a language is a black/white thing - 
            either you speak it or you don't and you cannot lie about it.
            Learning languages is my way of ensuring myself to trust the process.
            Even though I feel like I am not learning, I am actually improving step-by-step.
            The key word to being able to learn a language from 0 to 100, 
            and to finish anything is "ç­‰". Those who are patient will be rewarded.
