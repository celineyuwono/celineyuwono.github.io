            <br/>I have a hard time finishing things. I often get bored along the way.
            <br/>Being able to speak a language is a black/white thing - 
            <br/>either you speak it or you don't and you cannot lie about it.
            <br/>Learning languages is my way of ensuring myself to trust the process.
            <br/>Even though I feel like I am not learning, I am actually improving step-by-step.
            <br/>The key word to being able to learn a language from 0 to 100, 
            <br/>and to finish anything is "ç­‰". Those who are patient will be rewarded.
