            I like travelling, who doesn't? 
            <br/>But what I like more is living in a city/country for an extended period of time. 
            <br/>Not only you can travel to nearby countries cheaper and without rush,
            <br/>You can learn the culture, language, and meet people who live in that place.
            <br/>If they are the locals, see how the city/country influences nurture.
            <br/>If they are non-locals, see why they are living in that city/country.
            <br/>Being interested in people is important in order to develop empathy and respect.
            <br/>Never think you are the smartest/best, and see what you can learn from other people.
