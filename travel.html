            I like travelling, who doesn't? 
            But what I like more is living in a city/country for an extended period of time. 
            Not only you can travel to nearby countries cheaper and without rush,
            You can learn the culture, language, and meet people who live in that place.
            If they are the locals, see how the city/country influences nurture.
            If they are non-locals, see why they are living in that city/country.
            Being interested in people is important in order to develop empathy and respect.
            Never think you are the smartest/best, and see what you can learn from other people.
